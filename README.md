Binary Trees

main

This program assignment uses the code examples in the textbook (Chapter 19) to generate and traverse a Binary Search Tree.  
Your program should complete the following tasks:

Open a file (named "treedata.txt") which contains integer values.  Your program should read integers from the file (until end of file is reached), and insert each integer (one at a time) into a Binary Search Tree (assume the integers are in ascending order in the file).
Once the tree is contructed, you should display a menu with the following options:
Insert a value into the tree
Delete a value from the tree
Display the tree (in order)
Exit
If option 1 is chosen, ask for an integer, and then insert that integer into the tree (using the functions provided in the ADT)

If option 2 is chosen, ask for an integer to delete, and then delete that integer, and rearrange the values in the tree (according to the code provided in the ADT; make sure to consider all 4 cases)

If option 3 is chosen, display the contents of the tree (hint: use one of the traversal functions)
